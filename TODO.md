- fix before() function, which is subtly broken
- explain the regex invariant.
- add throttle, which collects all the tokens and lets them through at most once every n ms
- minimum inter-token delay, which allows you to do stuff like 100ms per token simulated streaming
- write a .replaceAll function
- write a .endIf function ? which ends if something is detected in the stream?
- try to write the JSON thing and see if there's any way to make it easier.
